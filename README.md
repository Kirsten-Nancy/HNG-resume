### Error Fixed

- A width of 100rem that was added to each card, that made them not to be responsive has been removed.
- Also, a new container tag, main, was added to properly align both the header and main tag children using flexbox.
- Added media queries for small screens and adjusted the font-sizes

### Happy coding!!! ðŸ™‚
